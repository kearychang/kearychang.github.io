Greetings to readers.

If you wanted an explosive introduction, this is more of a preface of what future content there will be. All that I'm willing to disclose about myself at the time is in my public accounts - LinkedIn, Github and the short blurb in the About section. 

I plan to blog about personal thoughts, AI, NLP, computer network, DB, algorithm, front end, back end and books. If those subjects seem overly broad, they will be at an introductory level, corresponding to my depth of my understanding of the subject matter. With time, as my understanding improves, I may add more tags.

I hope to seriously get into reading. Currently on my reading list are the sci fi classics: **1984, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Brave New World, The Hyperion Cantos, Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy**, short stories by Isaac Asimov: **I, Robot, Of Time and Space and Other Things** and amalgams of philosophy-CS-AI-math: **I am a Strange Loop, Superintelligence**.

At the moment, comments are not enabled. I don't know what direction this blog will take and the quantity of readership. If I decide that I post with enough regularity and depth in subject, I will open it to discussion.

Lastly, I anticipate that that the reading experience will quickly become bogged by this site's poor blog design. While it is built on Jekyll, it is single column and doesn't support search. Readers do not readily see the most recent posting so that will have to be added.
