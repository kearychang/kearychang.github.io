<center>A beautiful way to visualize JSON information.</center>
     
This [project](https://github.com/kearychang/logDNAHomePage/) was to implement the front end based on a given image.  
Libraries used were LESS and jQuery. There is some basic interactivity. You can  
1. show/hide sidebar by toggling menu button on top right
2. change view of Lorem Ipsum by selecting channel squares on sidebar
3. select a particular Lorem Ipsum by clicking it

This UI is also responsive for different screens - mobile or desktop.
