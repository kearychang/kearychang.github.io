## A bit about me
I guess all programmers have some story about what magically drew them to type characters into a keyboard for a living.
My first program was a custom map for Warcraft 3, written in vJASS which was the editor's C-like language.
But my interest in programming and computer science came some years later after taking an online introductory programming course.
It was something about the elegance of discovering beautiful solutions to a problem and the creativity of the task that hooked me.
Now I'm a graduate in computer science and since then, I've been devoting time to improving my fundamentals in programming languages, data structures and algorithms, learning web development and branching into NLP and AI.
I hope to create useful and beautiful software.
